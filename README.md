# Frame_GA
Frame optimization using Genetic Algorithm in python

This is the frame topology optimization program using Genetic Algorithm(GA).
There are many types of GA. The type of GA in this program is developed from professor Yamamoto Kenji and Minakawa Youichi.

The repository includes 4 files

1. FEM_frame.py : 3D Frame structural analysis file
2. frame_GEN.py : Frame structure generate file
3. frame_GA.py : Genetic Algorithm file
4. master_frame_GA.py : Main file
